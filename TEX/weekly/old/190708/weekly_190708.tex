\begin{multicols}{2}
\raggedright
	\paragraph{Recent Progress:}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item One week left on contract.
		\item Improved miniWECC validation graphs.
		\item 3 Area miniWECC created. Initial BA tests are similar to six machine results.
		\item Stepping Pm of a governed generator tested. (governor states must be set)
		

	%	\item More \verb|matplotlib| plot functions created.

		\item GitHub updated:\\
		\verb|https://github.com/thadhaines/|
		
	\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Current Tasks:}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Work on miniWECC case development.

		\item Continue to Update Code flowchart to aid in further development.

		\item Continue to Refine BA ACE actions.

		\item Bring wind into simulation? \\ (ramp ungoverned generators) ?

		\item Find best way to trip gens in PSLF from python.

		
		%\item Keep Goals and Requests in mind.
		
		%\subitem A FlowtabrDAO exists that can find flow between busses. A way to initialize bus connections between areas has yet to be devised.

	\end{enumerate}

	\paragraph{Current Questions:}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Should the exponential load model be a priority?\\
(RJ miniWECC had Q as constant impedance, P as constant current)

	
	\item What is the end goal of this research?
	\subitem Develop a simulation framework to facilitate the analysis of long-term power system dynamics	with a focus on governor and AGC interaction to various perturbances.
	
	 Simulation uses large time steps, ignores inter-machine oscillations, utilizes a time sequence of power flows for system bus states, a single aggregate swing equation for frequency, and uses reduced governor models.

\paragraph{Future Tasks: (possibly by me)} %(Little to No Progress since last time / Things coming down the pipe)
	\begin{enumerate}

		\item Use generic governor for non-modeled governors (WECC)

		\item Account for different types of loads? (exponential load model) % read from dyd
		
		\item Add import mirror / bypass mirror init sequence option to prevent repeated mirror creations.

		\item Investigate line current data.
		
	\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Future Work: (not by me)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Work to incorporate Matt's \emph{Suggested Use Cases} into simulation.
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Add Shunt Group Agent
		\item Work to Define Definite Time Controller user input
		\end{itemize} 
\item Formulate feasible plan of action for casting all WECC governors to LTD governors (tgov1). Possibly:
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item Parse models of interest from dyd.
		\item Create dyd from parsed model.
		\item Automate a 'scaled' Pref step test for a one machine infinite bus in PSDS.
		\item Read and analyze output data
		\item Generate/Calculate LTD equivalent model parameters from results (this will probably use MATLAB and \verb|jfind|)
		\item Export custom dyd for LTD simulation. (PSDS would still use original the dyd, though \emph{could} use modified dyd)
		\end{enumerate}

		\item Investigate ULTC action.

		\item Create an agent for every object: \\ ULTC, SVD, Transformer, \ldots
		
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Matt Requests:}
\begin{enumerate}
		\item Enable multiple dyd files to overwrite / replace previously defined agents/parameters
		\item Allow for variable time steps.
\end{enumerate}

	\end{enumerate}

%\paragraph{'Soft Goals':}
%	\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Write Thesis 2020
%	\end{enumerate}

	\paragraph{Deviation Plots:} To make large numbers of comparisons easier to comprehend], deviation plots were created to show the difference between LTD and PSDS data.\\
	
	One way to think of these plots is $\text{LTD}_{data}+\text{Deviation}_{data} = \text{PSDS}_{data}$. \\(Assuming all time step issues are handled appropriately.)\\
	
	Alternatively, the deviation data could be thought of as data that is filtered out due to the larger time steps and assumptions made by LTD.\\

	Angle deviation not included as PSDS angles wrap oddly and would result in a misleading deviation.
