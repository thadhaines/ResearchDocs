	\paragraph{Recent Progress:}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Program form and Committee form filed in Grad Office 
		\item Graduate seminar presentation scheduled for Oct 22nd
		\item PSDS WECC / MiniWECC PSS work
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 100GW\_ALS\_SHAWN.sav runs flatlines. SVDs act, $f$ inc by \approx 4.2 mHz, Pg inc by 0.003x
%SVDs turn on and off at t=25 and 50 respectively. 
%System speed increases by 0.0007 pu (4.2 mHz). 
%Pg may increase from initial value by 0.003 times.
			\item Dynamic simulation errors in 16HS3a and 18HSP2a probably related to \verb|dcc| table entries of \verb|nan| and \verb|-nan(ind)|
			\item PSS takes $\approx$45 seconds of flatlines to settle - can't seem to avoid.
			\item PSS has most effect on Reactive Power Output and Bus Voltages.
		\end{itemize}
		\item BA control can now include windowed IACE. Ramp results on reverse.
		\item Area agents log area losses.

	%	\item More \verb|matplotlib| plot functions created.

		\item GitHub updated:\\
		\verb|https://github.com/thadhaines/|
		
	\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Current Tasks:}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Continue to Refine BA ACE actions.

		\item Work on miniWECC and WECC integration.

		\item Update Code flowchart% to aid in further development.
		
		\item Outline thesis \& presentation

		
		%\item Keep Goals and Requests in mind.
		
		%\subitem A FlowtabrDAO exists that can find flow between busses. A way to initialize bus connections between areas has yet to be devised.

	\end{enumerate}

	\paragraph{Current Questions:}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item How to best deal with PSDS PSS issues (system is not in steady state at simulation start). Does it really matter?
		
	\item Realistic AGC results?
	\item Typical deadbands of AGC?
	\item Recommended deadbands of  governors? Intentional: 36 mHz max (NERC), \\Inherent: less than 5 mHz

\paragraph{Future Tasks:} %(Little to No Progress since last time / Things coming down the pipe)
	\begin{enumerate}

		\item Use generic governor for non-modeled governors (WECC) - estimate tgov1 time constants from machine H (and MW cap?).		
		
		\item Add import mirror / bypass mirror init sequence option to prevent repeated mirror creations.

		\item Bring wind into simulation \\ (ramp ungoverned generators?)

		\item Find best/correct way to trip gens in PSLF from python.

		\item Investigate line current data.
		
	\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Future Work: (not by me)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Account for different types of loads. (exponential load model) % read from dyd
\item Work to incorporate Matt's \emph{Suggested Use Cases} into simulation.
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Add Shunt Group Agent
		\item Work to Define Definite Time Controller user input
		\end{itemize} 


		\item Investigate ULTC action.

		\item Create an agent for every object: \\ ULTC, SVD, Transformer, \ldots

		\item Get away from reliance on GE
		
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Matt Requests:}
\begin{enumerate}
		\item Enable multiple dyd files to overwrite / replace previously defined agents/parameters
		\item Allow for variable time steps.
\end{enumerate}

	\end{enumerate}

%\paragraph{'Soft Goals':}
%	\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Write Thesis 2020
%	\end{enumerate}
		

\begin{comment}

\item Formulate feasible plan of action for casting all WECC governors to LTD governors (tgov1). Possibly:
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item Parse models of interest from dyd.
		\item Create dyd from parsed model.
		\item Automate a 'scaled' Pref step test for a one machine infinite bus in PSDS.
		\item Read and analyze output data
		\item Generate/Calculate LTD equivalent model parameters from results (this will probably use MATLAB and \verb|jfind|)
		\item Export custom dyd for LTD simulation. (PSDS would still use original the dyd, though \emph{could} use modified dyd)
		\end{enumerate}

	\paragraph{Deviation Plots:} To make large numbers of comparisons easier to comprehend], deviation plots were created to show the difference between LTD and PSDS data.\\
	
	One way to think of these plots is $\text{LTD}_{data}+\text{Deviation}_{data} = \text{PSDS}_{data}$. \\(Assuming all time step issues are handled appropriately.)\\
	
	Alternatively, the deviation data could be thought of as data that is filtered out due to the larger time steps and assumptions made by LTD.\\

	Angle deviation not included as PSDS angles wrap oddly and would result in a misleading deviation.
